In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use __iter__ first, which returns an object that supports the iteration protocol with a __next__ method: if no __iter__ is found by inheritance search, Python falls back on the __getitem__ indexing method, which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes. If used, the yield statement can create the __next__ method automatically."

The former is called by the print and str built-in functions; the latter is called by print and str if there is no __str__, and always by the repr built-in, interactive echoes, and nested appearances. That is,__repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user-friendly displays; __repr__ gives extra details or the object’s as-code form."

For example, collections might imitate sequence or mapping interfaces, and callables might be coded for use with an API that expects a function. You generally shouldn’t implement expression operators if they don’t naturally map to your objects naturally and logically, though—use normally named methods instead."
